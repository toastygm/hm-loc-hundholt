# HârnWorld Location Module: Hundholt

Hundholt Manor is a "Location Module" for the Foundry VTT system. This location module
is designed to depict the Hundholt Manor and Fethael Hundred moot in the far north of
he Kingdom of Kaldor, on the island of Hârn in the [HârnWorld](https://columbiagames.com/harnworld/) fantasy
setting; however, this manor could be adapted to exist anywhere in any fantasy setting.

Although designed for use with the [HârnMaster](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/hm3)
system, this module is mostly system-agnostic.  Detailed descriptions of the actors
has been provided in journal entries to facilitate conversion to other game systems.

# Maps
