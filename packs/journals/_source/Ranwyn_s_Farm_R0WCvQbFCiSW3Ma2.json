        "content": "<h1>Ranwyn's Farm</h1>\n<p>As a response to the recent bandit attacks, Baron Indama has engaged the services of several young knights to serve as his Foresters. The road that passes the farm leads to the hamlet of Wuven. The cottars that work the farm’s land come from there and are all Tolonans.</p>\n<p>The farm lay fallow for about year after a raid killed the old man’s family and ran off his livestock. Oldial has worked hard to rebuild the farm and Sir Haradoc has offered tax relief for providing the Foresters food and lodging. When this subsidy is combined with the provisions that the knights buy and the servants that they employ, Oldial’s family lives quite comfortably.</p>\n<p>Currently, the farm is about three-quarters rebuilt. The old stables are still a shell, there a large hole in the barn’s roof, and the back fence cannot keep the chickens, pigs, and goats inside the compound much less keep anything out. The farmhouse is snug and dry, however, and Mistress Forilëa is usually in the kitchen with some hot, filling food to serve. The farmhouse and barn have thick stone walls and thatched roofs.</p>\n<p>The farmyard is mud for most of the year. Dung heaps and agricultural waste stand piled in the corners of the barn and the yard. Oldial’s family has worked hard to clean up the farmstead but litter from its previous tenants and the attack still clutters the place.</p>\n<p>With the addition of the five young knights, the atmosphere at the farm has become one of post-adolescent squalor despite the mistress’ best attempts to maintain a clean and orderly house.</p>\n<h3>Ground Floor</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.R0WCvQbFCiSW3Ma2.JournalEntryPage.fApeqVpVzEWrNKJl]{[R1] Barn}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.R0WCvQbFCiSW3Ma2.JournalEntryPage.BjgdkK227iXR3UjT]{[R2] Old Stables}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.R0WCvQbFCiSW3Ma2.JournalEntryPage.SsFKhFcx0dCbcf0M]{[R3] Livestock Pens}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.R0WCvQbFCiSW3Ma2.JournalEntryPage.B9rdDCLU4wpuQJzr]{[R4] Kitchen}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.R0WCvQbFCiSW3Ma2.JournalEntryPage.sX73aI9k97rDuEvK]{[R5] Hall and Main Room}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.R0WCvQbFCiSW3Ma2.JournalEntryPage.3pN6GzMeh2shdHfo]{[R6] Oldial's Rooms}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.R0WCvQbFCiSW3Ma2.JournalEntryPage.fUwsuphWkQNRn3kD]{[R7] Children's Room}</li>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.R0WCvQbFCiSW3Ma2.JournalEntryPage.I6N0JIpXbjN19s73]{[R8] Servant's Room}</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Upper Floor</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>@UUID[JournalEntry.R0WCvQbFCiSW3Ma2.JournalEntryPage.WHC95fHgfZuXK9V1]{[R9] Knight-Foresters' Room}</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>",
