He is an acknowledged bastard; one of many that Sir Anetto Cybrela has sired. His clan head refuses to acknowledge him, however, and his support falls solely on his father’s purse. Arlin is armored as a Poor Knight, with a poor allowance. Shendal Karlirien is the 5th son of a vassal of the Pomada, holders of Ixena manor in Lynnfana Hundred. His mother ran off with a minstrel when he was 10. As a result, he is devoted to his father. His father’s brother is the clanhead. His uncle has no particular antipathy toward the young man but doesn’t really take the time to notice him either. Shendal is armored as a Poor Knight but receives an average allowance.</p>\n<p> </p>",
